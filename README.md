<strong>Description:</strong>

The following workshop lets you practice basic java coding techniques, creating classes, methods, using arrays, Java I/O, inheritance, polymorphism, Exceptional Handling, JavaFx (GUI), Lambda expressions, Functional Interface, Collection Framework.




<strong>Task 1: </strong>

<strong>                </strong>In workshop 6 we used baby name ranking files, this workshop going to use the same files,




Part – 1.

<ol>

 <li>Write a program that prompts the user to enter one of the <em>filenames</em> from baby ranking and displays the names that are used for both genders in the file.</li>

 <li>Use Lists to store the names and find common names in two lists.</li>

</ol>




Here is a sample run:

Enter a file name for baby name ranking: babynamesranking2010.txt

68 names used for both genders

They are Charlie Emerson Morgan …

Part – 2.

<ol>

 <li>Sort all names for boys and girls in their lists.</li>

 <li>Remove the duplicates.</li>

 <li>Display the sorted names individually</li>

 <li>Design out own output for this part.</li>

 <li>For sorting method from Collection interface.</li>

</ol>

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Task 2: (Design your own output for this you are free to use JavaFX or not) </strong>




Assume that <strong>25</strong> countries and their capitals are stored in a map. Your program should prompt     the user to enter a country and should display the capital for that country.

Deliverables and Important Notes:




<strong>All these deliverables are supposed to be uploaded on the blackboard once done. </strong>

<strong> </strong>

<ul>

 <li>You are supposed to create video/ record voice/ detailed document of your running solution. <strong>(50%)</strong>  o Screen Video captured file should state your last name and id, like</li>

</ul>

Ali_123456.mp4 (or whatever the extension of the file is) o Record voice clip should also include a separate word file with the screen shots of your program’s output, state your last name and id, like Ali_123456.mp3 (or whatever the extension of the file is)

o Detailed document should include screen shots of your output, have your name and id on the top of the file and save the file with your last name and id, like Ali_123456.docx (or whatever the extension of the file is)

<ul>

 <li>A word/ text file which will reflect on learning of your concepts in this workshop. Also include the instructions on how to run your code.                                 <strong>(30%)</strong>

  <ul>

   <li>Should state your Full name and Id on the top of the file and save the file with your last name and id, like Ali_123456.txt</li>

  </ul></li>
